## Overview

This repository contains the research behind the "Pirolo Vortex", a novel framework that maps integers to a 3D vector space defined by the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function.

The core discovery is a fundamental law connecting the arithmetic properties of a semiprime number (N=pq) to the geometric properties of a triangle formed by its constituents (p, q, and N) within the Vortex.

## Key Result

The central finding is a perfect functional relationship between the arithmetic balance of the factors (the ratio q/p) and the geometric balance of the triangle (its isoscelesness). This provides a new, visual way to analyze the multiplicative structure of integers.
